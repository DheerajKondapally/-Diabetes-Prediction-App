📌 About the Project
This app predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on several health-related parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, and more. The backend is powered by machine learning models — specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — trained on a well-known dataset related to diabetes diagnosis.

The project highlights:

🔬 Use of SVM and KNN classifiers
⚡ Instant predictions via a web interface
🧠 Pre-trained model with .pkl serialization
🎛️ Clean and responsive UI with Gradio
This project is meant for educational purposes, showing how machine learning can be deployed for real-world predictions in healthcare.
